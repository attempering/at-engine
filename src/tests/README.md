# Testing programs

Many test programs have been built into the project.

Normally, test in this order:

1. [Compiling and memory tests](basic_tests)
2. [Unit tests for features and functionalities](unit_tests)
3. [Sample programs](sample_progs) Sample test cases using the API offered by the kernel files
4. [Basic tests to the GROMACS 4.6 plugins](../interface/gromacs/4.6/_tests)
